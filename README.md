## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gold-price-prediction.git

2. Open the notebook:
      Upload Gold_Price_Prediction.ipynb to Google Colab
      Or run locally using Jupyter Notebook

3. Install dependencies:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run all cells to train the model and view predictions.

📈 Results

1. The model predicts gold prices with reasonable accuracy.

2. Performance metrics used:
      Mean Squared Error (MSE)
      R² Score

3. Visualization of actual vs predicted prices is included.
